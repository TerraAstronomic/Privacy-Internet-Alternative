The internet is increasingly filled with platforms demanding personal identification—IDs, passports, driver’s licenses, and more. This erodes our autonomy and makes it harder to maintain a free, healthy perspective on our own lives. The struggle for digital privacy isn’t just about the dark web or darknet; it’s about preserving fundamental human dignity and resisting the reduction of individuals to mere data points for governments or corporations. 

While surveillance systems exist globally—including in places like China—the issue isn’t confined to any single region. Corruption, overreach, and centralized control affect democracies and authoritarian states alike, often leaving ordinary people feeling powerless. 

We believe the internet must be freed—not just as an ideal, but as a practical, technical endeavor. Since the 1990s, the promise of digital democracy has been compromised. Our goal is to rebuild internet infrastructure using proven, open algorithms to enable uncensored, private, and resilient communication for everyone, everywhere. 
What “Uncensored” Means to Us 

The ability to seek, share, and discuss the closest approximation of truth—recognizing that absolute truth is elusive, especially in the modern information age.
Freedom from persecution for what you read, write, or believe.
Ensuring future generations inherit a web that supports open inquiry and global knowledge.
     

This project aims to support communication in all countries, including those with heavy censorship like Iran, China, and others. We’re building tools that empower people—not platforms or states. 

Join us in reimagining the architecture of the internet: decentralized, human-centered, and truly open.
